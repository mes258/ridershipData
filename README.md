# ridershipData

I intially wrote these scripts specifically for processing data from King County Metro. Now that we have Community Transit data as well, I'm in the process of refactoring every method to work with various transit agencies/formats. This is still a work in progess and the scripts do not work right now. I'll update this when everything is working again.
